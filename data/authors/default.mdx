I'm a developer with a passion for **front-end development** and **information design**.
In the last five years, I've specialized in **data visualization**. I enjoy the unique challenges required to work with complex datasets, balance designing for engagement and accuracy, and craft bespoke visualizations that are performant, accessible, and responsive.

Recently, I've delved into the world of data analytics, earning [The Data Analytics Professional certificate with DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0028312624544). I've also been exploring the fascinating realm of **geospatial data visualization**, particularly with **Three.js** and **WebGL**.

In the next five years, I plan to learn more about analytics, become more specialized, and focus on **creating higher-level tools** to help others craft their visualizations.
